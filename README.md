Application designed to receive the necessary information from the user to automatically filled your job application. The goal for this project is to allowed the user to answer specific questions which will simplify the process of a job application. Once the individual answers the corresponding questions, a resume will be built an suggested job applications will be offered. The idea is that the user does not have to enter every company website in order to apply for that company. Once applied, the next step of a job application (either the interview, assigment, or steps) of the company will be directly dealt with by the user.
